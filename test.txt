Tokenization is the process of breaking down 
a sequence of text into smaller units called tokens,
which can be words, phrases, or even individual characters.
Tokenization is often the first step in natural languages processing tasks 
such as text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
The resulting tokens are typically used as input to further processing steps,
such as vectorization, where the tokens are converted
into numerical representations for machine learning models to use.
